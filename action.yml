        # FOSSA has two kinds of API keys (aka tokens), a full-privilege key
        # and a low-privilege "push-only" key. The practical difference is that
        # the full key provides more feedback on `fossa test` failure. We have
        # a full key stored in org-wide GitHub Secrets, but a) we can't access
        # it in an action, only in a workflow (hence the input here) and b) it
        # isn't available even in a workflow when run in a PR from a fork. If
        # for any reason it's missing we fall back to a push-only key attached
        # to a low-privilege account, which is safe (enough) to expose publicly
        # here in this file and gives us at least basic pass/fail.
